# About this Program
## Background on Small World
Small World is one of the more interesting card in the game of Yu-Gi-Oh!. Using it, you can search for almost any monster in the game based upon your deck composition and a monster in your hand that you are willing to give up.

Every Yu-Gi-Oh monster has 5 characteristics that are vital to using Small World:
- Type
- Attribute
- Level
- ATK (Attack)
- DEF (Defense)

Small World uses exactly 1 characteristic to bridge from a Starting Card to a Bridge Card to the Target Card. To explain in detail:
1. Using the Starting Card, you would then find a card(s) in your deck that share exactly 1 characteristic with the Starting Card. This will be our Bridge Card.
2. Then using the Bridge Card, you would then find a card(s) in your deck that share exactly 1 characteristic with the Bridge Card. This will be our Target Card.

**DIAGRAM**: Starting Card ---bridges to---> Bridge Card ---bridges to---> Target Card

**e.g.** Blue-Eyes White Dragon -> Effect Veiler -> Dark Magician

In the above example, Blue-Eyes White Dragon and Effect Veiler only share exactly one characteristic in that they are both Light Attribute monsters. Then we check with
Effect Veiler and Dark Magician, these cards also share exactly one characteristic in that they both have the Spellcaster typing. So, we can bridge from Blue-Eyes 
White Dragon to Dark Magician using Small World.

**Note**: Monsters with undefined ATK or DEF indicated by ‘?’ cannot use that characteristic for bridging with Small World. The reason why is that currently ‘?’ ATK/DEF does not compare to anything (see related rulings).
## What this Program accomplishes
**Requirements**: A YDK file of your Yu-Gi-Oh! deck

This program is used to accomplish 3 things:
- Given a Starting Card and a Target Card, returns a list of possible Bridge Cards to complete Small World. 
- Return a list of cards that share exactly 1 characteristic based on a given card.
- Tells how well Small World would work in your deck.
